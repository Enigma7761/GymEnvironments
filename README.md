#About

This repository was for me messing around with deep reinforcement learning
algorithms, especially trying to implement them from their papers. I have since
abandoned this to make a new one because this one isn't well
structured and I have since realized some of the errors in the implementations.\

Below are some of agents I have properly trained, 
as well as a 2048 gym environment I implemented.

### Finished algorithms

![Bipedal Walker](bipedalwalker.gif)\
Implemented with a DDPG algorithm

![2048](2048.gif)\
Implemented with a DQN algorithm

![Pong](pong.gif)\
Implemented with a DQN algorithm

![Breakout](breakout.gif)\
There are two programs that work for Breakout, one PPO one Rainbow (Rainbow has some
implementation errors)
